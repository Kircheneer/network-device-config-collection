# Network Device Config Collection

The network device config collection is supposed to be a collection of configuration files for any type of network device. These configurations should then serve as the basis for network automation software development whenever real-life configurations are interesting. This means that all kinds of configurations are relevant to it, production or lab, good or bad or even faulty (not in syntax but in semantics), amateur or expert-level.

If you want to contribute, check out the [network device config collector](ndcc.leokirchner.de) or manually submit a pull request - for the path please use "configurations/{nos}/{name}.conf" where `nos` is a platform name for [netmiko](https://github.com/ktbyers/netmiko).
